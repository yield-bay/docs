A simple smart contract that enables liquidity provision for various pools from any token. This is as simple as exchanging your initial tokens for LP tokens to become a liquidity provider. This also addresses the 50-50 problem which is quite common in liquidity provision.

Compounding rewards make a massive difference over time.

If you are a liquidity provider, you get a constant stream of rewards. To compound them, you have to claim your rewards, then exchange them for the relevant farm tokens, and then re-allocate those funds to the Farm.

This takes multiple transactions to achieve and consumes more fees too.

Moreover, this was tedious enough to write, imagine actually doing this every day.

Snowball machine takes care of all this for you and saves you fees while doing it, so you have a smooth sailing experience while farming.

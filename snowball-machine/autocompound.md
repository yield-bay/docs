Albert Einstein once famously said, “Compound Interest is the eighth wonder of the world, the one who understands it, earns it, the one who doesn’t pay it.” In Yield Farming, there are daily rewards that can be accumulated every day, and reward tokens can be exchanged and reallocated in Yield Farms. But the problem with this is you have to make expensive transactions to convert the reward tokens into native tokens and then again the 50-50 problem. But compounding is a way where you can earn more reward tokens in the same amount of time. To give you a perspective, if you farmed with Autocompound, you earn approximately 5%-40% more in a given year as opposed to just Yield farming.

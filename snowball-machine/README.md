Keeping the power of compounding in mind, what if I told you, you can utilize it at your Yield farming experience! That’s where Snowball comes in! Consider an example: A farmer stakes $500 of USDC tokens into a farm. The farmer receives rewards worth 0.05 DOT per day. That means, on average, the farmer only generates enough value from claimed rewards to pay the gas costs by waiting for days or weeks. During this period where the farmer is waiting for the rewards to be worth claiming and compounding, they are at risk of the reward asset price shifting. What we do is, collect yield for everyone who has opted in for snowball, and then pools it again in a warp which would be chosen by the user. This adds the benefits of Less gas fess as it is a signal transaction and it is paid by the entire group instead of an individual. More APY for everyone who opts in as it is purely compounding.

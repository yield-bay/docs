## Bay Island Lost Map Lore

> As the legend goes, Captain RaÃ¯s found himself stranded on the mystical Bay Island after the Great Tsunami of Dotsama.
>
> He was one of the most ruthless pirates you would ever come across; a skilled navigator who had managed to conquer one sea after another. And his next conquest was going to be the treacherous Dotsama sea; he was out to steal the bountiful treasures it promised. &#x20;
>
> But he undermined the challenge in front of him and spent years finding his way across the sea, battling one demon after another.
>
> The climate was strange, the creatures despicable, the waves dangerous, but none could deter his vision.
>
> One evening after a relatively calm day, RaÃ¯s and his crew members were frantically searching for land to dock their ship after hearing a loud ocean roar. A tsunami was coming, and he knew his men and ship couldnâ€™t handle this hit.
>
> But there was nothing he could do.
>
> Aggressively, the waves, bigger than anyone can imagine came racing toward their ship, demolishing everything in their way.
>
> RaÃ¯s lost everything in what came to be known as the great tsunami of Dotsama. &#x20;
>
> The last thing he remembers is hearing the helpless cries of his crew members.&#x20;
>
> He spent hours looking for signs of any other living creature besides himself on the island, but it was all in vain.&#x20;
>
> He couldnâ€™t help but notice some strange behavior. His wounds seemed to have magically healed themselves, he didnâ€™t feel hungry or thirsty. He feltâ€¦ stronger.&#x20;
>
> He knew this was no ordinary island; there were some mystical powers at play here. And thatâ€™s when he knew that the waves brought him to the Bay Island.&#x20;
>
> And so RaÃ¯s stayed, harnessing its magical powers to help other sailors find their way around the perilous Dotsama sea.&#x20;
>
> And now, a pirate who LIVED for sailing, never plans to venture back into the sea.&#x20;
>
> The Bay Island's magic bestowed upon its arrivals, what they sought out in the perilous seas.

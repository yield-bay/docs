# 🔁 WARP

**UPDATE**

Warp is all set for a limited alpha release on 29th April, only for the holders of the Bay Island Lost Map NFT. Warp-out and liquidity positions tracker are still under development. Only Warp-In functionality will be launched on April 29th.

## _**Disclaimer**_

_Using WARP comes with abundant risk. It is currently in an unaudited alpha phase and easily could malfunction resulting in loss of funds._

## Why is WARP needed?

> **A big space-time distortion exists on the Bay Island. Known as the WARP zone among sailors, a magical tool that enables one to add liquidity to any pool on Solarbeam using any token in one's wallet.**

Liquidity pools are reserves of tokens secured in smart contracts. Their main goal is to facilitate trade between tokens.

The biggest hassle with liquidity pools is that you need to deposit the required tokens in an exact 50:50 ratio. Becoming a liquidity provider requires multiple pre-calculated transactions making the process unnecessarily complex.

And this is where we come in. The user connects their wallet at YieldBay and _WARPs_ into the liquidity pool in a single transaction.

## How does WARP work?

The user selects their desired pool from the list of active Solarbeam pools and a token from their wallet. WARP takes the token and splits it into two halves.

WARP, by interacting with the Solarbeam DEX Router, converts the halves into the two tokens needed to provide liquidity for that specific pool. After obtaining the required tokens, it puts them into the pool and transfers the LP tokens to you.

Warp-In lets the user provide liquidity to any Solarbeam pool using any token.

Warp-Out lets the user remove liquidity from a pool and returns either one of the tokens present in the pool or MOVR, depending on the user's choice.

# üîÅ Warp Beach

A big space-time distortion exists on this beach. Known as the _warp zone_ among sailors, it takes offerings in any token from a sailor and provides liquidity to his desired liquidity pool, taking care of all the intermittent swaps.&#x20;

It gives back valuable LP tokens in return to the sailor.\

[Captain Nightwing](https://twitter.com/nightwing\_yb) is experimenting with harnessing the power of this magical gateway to make it useful for all the new sailors docking at the Bay. His focus is on making the _warp zone_ return Solarbeam LP tokens.\
\
Once experimenting, the _warp zone_ also opened a path for him to receive sacred sROME from ancient Rome on any token offering.

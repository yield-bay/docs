# ðŸš§ Safety Score

## Description

This algorithm arrives at a final score for each farm by summing up the parameters described below according to their weights.

The final scores are then normalized to be more presentable & user-friendly.

| TVL        | 45% |
| ---------- | --- |
| Base APR   | 20% |
| Reward APR | 15% |
| Rewards    | 20% |

## Parameters <a href="#parameters" id="parameters"></a>

### TVL - 45% weightage <a href="#tvl-45-weightage" id="tvl-45-weightage"></a>

A fixed score is assigned out of 1 based on the liquidity range the farm lies in.

**Liquidity ranges:**

| Liquidity    | Score |
| ------------ | ----- |
| > $10M       | 1     |
| $1M - $10M   | 0.85  |
| $100k - $1M  | 0.75  |
| $10k - $100k | 0.6   |
| $1k - $10k   | 0.5   |

The above ranges and scores weâ€™ve arrived on by simulating different ranges on the data. These might not be ideal, but will work for the time being.

> Caveat: The ranges and the scores will need to be updated as the ecosystem grows.

### Base APR - 20% weightage <a href="#base-apr-20-weightage" id="base-apr-20-weightage"></a>

Normalized percentile-based scores for the base APR.

1. The highest base APR farm gets a score of 1.
2. The score for the rest of the farms is calculated by dividing their base APR by the highest base APR.

We donâ€™t have the base APRs for a lot of Stable AMM farms and there exists no concept of base APR for single-staking farms. Hence, they get a fixed score.

* Stable AMM - 0.6
* Single Staking - 0.3

### Reward APR - 15% weightage <a href="#reward-apr-15-weightage" id="reward-apr-15-weightage"></a>

Normalized percentile-based scores for the reward APR.

1. The highest reward APR gets a score of 1.
2. The score for the rest of the farms is calculated by dividing their reward APR by the highest reward APR.

### Rewards - 20% weightage <a href="#rewards-20-weightage" id="rewards-20-weightage"></a>

Normalized percentile-based scores for the absolute USD value of rewards being disbursed in the farm per day.

1. The highest reward USD value gets a score of 1.
2. The score for the rest of the farms is calculated by dividing their reward USD value by the highest reward USD value.

## Future Work <a href="#future-work" id="future-work"></a>

This algorithm should eventually evolve to include parameters like:

* Impermanent loss risk in the farm
* Quality of assets in the farm
* Etc.

Weâ€™ve started sowing the seeds for the same by scoping out the work for a v2 of our [Assets Repository](https://github.com/yield-bay/assets) to include the data for the assets that weâ€™d need to make the scoring algorithm more robust.\

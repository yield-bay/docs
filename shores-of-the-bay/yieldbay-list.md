# ðŸŒŸ Yieldbay List

We have curated a [platform](https://list.yieldbay.io/) for finding and listing liquidity pools and yield farms within the Dotsama ecosystem as an effort to reduce information asymmetry and lower the barrier to entry for liquidity providers and yield farmers within the Dotsama ecosystem and make it easier for protocols to acquire liquidity for their token pools.

Currently listing 150+ farms and 14 Protocols, we are your Portal for Defi in the Polkadot and Kusama Paraverse.&#x20;

Ranking the protocols on the basis of their TVL, APR and [Safety Score](broken-reference), we aim to be as concise and informative for our users.&#x20;

On the individual farm pages, we provide you with detailed breakups for each farm, their APR reward breakups, custom length ROIs and so much more.&#x20;

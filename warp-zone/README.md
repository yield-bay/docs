# 🔁 Warp Zone

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Warp portal.png>)

We created Warp as a solution for the 50-50 problem. What you have to do is, just connect your wallet at YieldBay, and move through the warp by just pressing a button and the funds rebalancing is enabled by a smart contract. You won’t have to convert the funds yourself and balance the change which is market-dependent. You just have to press a button, and our smart contract will take it from there!

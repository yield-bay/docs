  In the vast and stormy sea of Dotsama where one constantly fights with
  difficult-to-use platforms and not-so-smart contracts, the Bay is a safe shore
  where sailors can kick back and relax.

# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to The Bay

At the Bay, we work to save you time and help you earn more yield, so you can enjoy your well-deserved reward after ages of sailing the waves in search of yield-farming treasures.\

No sailor that has stepped on the shores of the Bay has ever ventured back into the sea.

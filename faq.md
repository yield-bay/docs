**What is the risk associated with Warp?**&#x20;

Smart Contract Risk Interacting with smart contracts is always risky. More so when you stack them on top of each other to form a chain of functionality. The boon of Defi, composability – protocols interacting with each other on the blockchain, ends up being the bane a few times as well.

Impermanent Loss Providing liquidity on a decentralized exchange comes with certain kinds of economic risks. A liquidity pool on Solarbeam consists of two tokens, present in a pool in a certain ratio, which defines the exchange rate between them. For example, if the ratio between token A & B is 1:1, you can give the pool 1 A, and receive 1 B back. But if the ratio is 2:1, you can give the pool 2 A, and receive 1 B back. The ratio depends on the exchange rate of the two tokens. The bigger the deviation in the exchange rate compared to when you provided liquidity, the bigger the possible loss compared to just holding the tokens.

**How much do I earn per transaction across the liquidity pool?**&#x20;

When somebody performs a swap that utilizes the liquidity pool you’ve provided liquidity to, they pay a 0.3%, 0.25% is added to the liquidity pool. This fee added to the liquidity pool is essentially revenue shared between all the liquidity providers. Hence, your earnings are – (volume of the pool \* 0.025%) \* (your LP tokens / total LP tokens)

**How do I exchange my LP token for a stable coin?**

&#x20;When you want to exit your position, you can use Warp to convert your LP tokens to any of the three - $MOVR, or one of the tokens present in the pool. If one of the tokens present in the pool is a stable coin, you can `warp out` to them. Or, warp out to MOVR, and convert that to a stable coin through Solarbeam.

**How do I exchange my reward tokens for a stable coin?**&#x20;

In Snowball, the reward token is continuously converted to the principle token and re-invested. When you’re removing your principle from the Snowball vault, you have the option to withdraw in multiple different tokens, where you can choose to withdraw in a stable coin.
